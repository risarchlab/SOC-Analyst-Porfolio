# SOC Level 1 - Log Analysis with SIEM

This repository documents **hands-on SOC Level 1 investigations** conducted using **Splunk SIEM** in the *TryHackMe – Log Analysis with SIEM* lab. The focus of this portfolio is **alert triage, log investigation, and escalation-style analysis**, mirroring real-world blue team responsibilities in a Security Operations Centre.

> **Role Focus:** SOC Analyst Level 1 | Defensive Security | Monitoring & Triage

---

## 🧠 Core SOC Skills Demonstrated

* Monitoring and triaging SIEM alerts
* Investigating suspicious activity across multiple log sources
* Writing SPL queries to validate or dismiss alerts
* Correlating host, network, and web logs
* Identifying attack stages and persistence mechanisms
* Documenting findings for escalation to SOC L2

---

## 🛠 SOC Tooling & Log Sources

* **Splunk SIEM** (search, filtering, correlation)
* **Sysmon** (process, network, and persistence visibility)
* **Windows Event Logs** (Security & System)
* **Linux auth.log & syslog**
* **Web server access logs**
* **TryHackMe simulated SOC environment**

## 🚨 SOC Investigation Scenarios

### 1️⃣ Windows Endpoint Alert Triage

**Alert Type:** Suspicious PowerShell Execution

**SOC Actions:**

* Investigated Sysmon EventCode 1 for encoded PowerShell commands
* Identified parent-child process relationships
* Validated malicious execution path and user context
* Correlated with outbound network alerts (EventCode 3)

**Outcome:** Confirmed malicious execution and potential C2 communication. Findings prepared for escalation.

**Example SPL:**

```spl
index=winenv EventCode=1 *_powershell* AND *EncodedCommand*
| table _time ComputerName ParentUser ParentImage Image CommandLine
```

---

### 2️⃣ Linux Server Alert Validation

**Alert Type:** Unusual SSH Login Activity

**SOC Actions:**

* Reviewed authentication logs for failed vs successful logins
* Identified brute-force pattern followed by successful access
* Detected privilege escalation to root
* Investigated syslog for persistence mechanisms

**Outcome:** Confirmed compromise and persistence via cron job. Escalated to SOC L2.

**Example SPL:**

```spl
index=linux source="auth.log" process=sshd
| search "Accepted password" OR "Failed password"
```

---

### 3️⃣ Web Application Alert Investigation

**Alert Type:** Spike in Web Server Requests

**SOC Actions:**

* Filtered access logs for authentication endpoints
* Identified excessive POST requests to `/wp-login.php`
* Classified activity as brute-force attack
* Identified attacker tooling via User-Agent analysis

**Outcome:** Confirmed WordPress brute-force activity using WPScan.

**Example SPL:**

```spl
index=task6 method=POST uri_path="/wp-login.php"
| stats count by clientip
| where count > 25
```

---

## 📊 Detection Coverage (SOC-Relevant)

* Endpoint execution anomalies
* Brute-force authentication attempts
* Suspicious outbound network connections
* Privilege escalation indicators
* Persistence via services and cron jobs
* Web-based attacks (brute force, web shells, DDoS indicators)

---

## 🧾 SOC Learning Outcomes

* Developed SOC-style investigative workflows
* Improved alert validation and false-positive analysis
* Strengthened understanding of attacker behavior post-compromise
* Practiced documentation suitable for ticketing and escalation

---

## 📌 Environment Notes

* All activity occurred in a controlled lab environment
* Data reflects simulated enterprise scenarios
* Content is intended for defensive security learning and portfolio use

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (SOC Growth)

* Build Splunk alert logic and thresholds
* Map alerts to MITRE ATT&CK techniques
* Practice shift handover and escalation notes
* Expand investigations to cloud and identity logs
